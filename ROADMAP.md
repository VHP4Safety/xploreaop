## Furture work and features to be added
Based on critical peer feedback, e.g from paper submissions or direct feedback from colleagues and co-workers, we are collecting bugs and feature requests in this roadmap.

## Bugs

 - [ ] It has been observed that when selecting a great number of compounds, or compounds that have many edges, the network visualization engine tend to become instable and 'hangs'. This causes a wiry and 'wringling' behaviour of the in-app visulaizations. We recommend trying to view the app on a bigger screen, increasing the resolution, lowering the browser zoom (cntrl/cmd + plus). We are looking for a more user friendly solution. This work is tracked as an issue [here]
(https://github.com/ontox-project/xploreaop/issues/3) 
- [ ] Sometimes a connection turns out to have no attached references. In practice this cannot be, because all information in the network is backed by one or multiple literature sources. This probably has an oprigin in the query turning up empty from the PubMed API. We are looking for a more stable solution, that involves a more static lookup. This work is tracked as an issue [here](https://github.com/ontox-project/xploreaop/issues/4)
 - [ ] More bugs will added to this list, when they appear

## Features
A number of requests for added features have been brought to our attention. We list them here, and link to existing issues, if applicable.

 - [ ] the dataset used for visualization also contains information on animal `species`, we are looking for ways to incorporate this information in the app. This feature has it's own `feature request` [issue](https://github.com/ontox-project/xploreaop/issues/5)
 - [ ] More feature requests will be added to this list
